<h3>Raid of the Time Traveling Lunch Demons</h3>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The world has been thrown into chaos by the likes of the time traveling lunch demons. They will not cease until their fiendish sandwiches have been forcebly devoured by every generation. Survive the onslaught, for if you do not, there may be no other generation to feed.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will experience a challenge as they try to compete to get the highest score in seconds, while finding out the flaws in my code for a high score.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Simple arcade style game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Dodge the lunch demons with your cursor, survive the longest without allowing them to feed you with their temporal sandwiches.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game is prototyping my use of cursor movement, sprite reviving, physics, phases and events.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The demons spawn at a random point in the top of the screen and accelerate towards the cursor depending on how far away the cursor is. If you decide to read the Readme this far, one of the flaws I could not figure out how to implement was fixing the cursor. If you hold the cursor still, it does not activate the on
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
After a temporal rift opens up to allow them to travel through time and space, the lunch demons have come to force their temporal sandwiches on the unwilling victims of every time period. They have filled each sandwich with mind controlling slime to ensure their future becomes tailored around their rule. Stop them, save the world, yada yada. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Story above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is for anyone and everyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Depending on your skill, and the amount of people you are playing against for the high score, it could be a while.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is a lot of randomness to the spawning and the acceleration of the demons so finding a strategy would be difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Images from Google slightly Photoshop'd.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Closest would probably be a meteor type game?
